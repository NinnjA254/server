Should specific employees handle specific inspections, sales and/or acquisitions? 
    Should employees have roles? eg. Point of sale, handler of acquisitions, etc??



Theres a problem with orders, If one makes an order, product quantity in store doesnt change:
    but what if before that order is fulfilled, another customer makes an order and fulfils it, eaving the store with fewer resources than required to fulfil the first order?
